1 General Help
::::::::::::::

For every non-shell program, you can use "--help" to get a full help.
(Note: If you need a file name for argv[1] which is 'help', write './help').
For shell programs, look into the files and find out which programs they call.

For syntax in the help descriptions, the following rules are used:

  * l|s means that either l or s is allowed (not both).
  * [argument] means that `argument' can be omitted.
  * <argument-description> means that you should not see `argument-description' as a
   string, but interpret it: e.g. call add <number> as `add 1' and not as `add number'.

2 Coordinates
:::::::::::::

For user interaction, cells are always numbered equally. Borders are not counted.
Numeration is

  * beginning with zero in the top left corner
  * increasing first by rows, then by columns

For using xy-coordinates, there is the 'coords' script. Try './coords --help'.

For programmers there are two formats to know:

  * The 'human' format, excluding borders, just described as above
  * The 'internal' format, like the human format, but including borders.
   It is used for all internal computations.

3 Input and Output types
::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are three types:

  * Sequences of numbers are ASCII printed numbers, separated by spaces or newlines
   (more exactly, you can use everything as a separator that fscanf sees as such)
  * Grids are ascii printed numbers in a rectangle, i.e. multiple rows of equal length
   of number sequences
  * The binary avalanche output format is not human readable for efficiency reasons.
   You can convert it to an ASCII sequence using io/avalanches_bin2human

4 Doxygen
:::::::::

Switch to the `doc' directory and type `./generate.sh'. This will generate doxygen help.
