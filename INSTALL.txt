0 Requirements
::::::::::::::

You will need the following libraries, headers and tools:

  g++>=4.8 or clang>=3.3 (clang is suggested)
  C++ 4.8 or higher
  boost (libboost-graph-dev)
  cmake
  Qt (if you want to build the GUI, libqt4-dev)
  imagemagick++ (libmagick++-dev)
  graphviz (for displaying dependency graphs)

1 Installation of the commandline interface
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this directory, type:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -DCOMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # TODO: define SCA_DEBUG, -Wall, -g

2 Installation of the Qt GUI
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The gui is built directly with the other tools, if you have qt installed.

3 Debugging
:::::::::::

The sca toosuite gives you debug output exactly if both of the following
conditions apply:

  1. you compiled with -DSCA_DEBUG (see (1) of this file)
  2. you set SCA_DEBUG=1 (or any other integer) in your shell

For the second condition, you can do either

  * SCA_DEBUG=1 ./path/program
  * export SCA_DEBUG=1; ./path/program

Debug output is always sent to stdout, so it does not affect pipelining.
